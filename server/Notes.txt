Camerlink seems to only work once after reboot. We need to look into this
at a later time. When it does work it doesn't keep up with the incomming data,
but the Xiao's code might be better at dealing with this than this.

Tryuing

Reboot
Turn on camera
RUn with -C cameralink off.
Try  cameralink program. This works.
Then try without -C
This works but CL does not keep up with data. THis may be the old code. It may
also be that this causes a buffer overflow to happen and this is the problem.
Will try something like the old code.
Still the second time we try it fails to ever work again..... New version of
code no better, in fact it may be worse. Let's just work with USB for now.
